          <p>
            \( \LaTeX \) is a typesetting program that helps many academics
            "typeset mathematical notation easily and legibly". In a way, it is
            similar to markup languages like Markdown, where we use various
            symbols to make it do what we want it to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            This getting started guide on \( \LaTeX \) is based on my notes of
            some of the videos in the video series titled "<a
              href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQTQDG8nyMPjlHdquBvv6f745YSY2Jylb"
              >Just Enough \( \LaTeX \) to Survive</a
            >" by Aaron Wong, Ph.d., which is uploaded on this YouTube channel
            called
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvO3V-CAyAaoQP3Ekd9ZDA"
              >The Math Repository</a
            >. This getting started guide will mainly focus on writing math
            notation in \( \LaTeX \).
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't gurantee the accuracy of this guide, as I'm a beginner.
            Nevertheless, I hope you find these notes to be helpful as a quick
            reference after watching the video series.

          <header><h2>Document structure</h2></header>
          <p>
            A \( \LaTeX \) doucment is made up of 2 main parts, which is the
            Preamble and Document environment.
          </p>
          <h3>Preamble</h3>
          <p>
            To me, this is similar to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of a
            webpage. You can type in several parameters of the document here.
            Some basic parameters are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>\documentclass{...}</code> specifies the type of document,
              and will load features according to their type. Common document
              types include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>\documentclass{article}</code>, which is used for
                  general document making and note-taking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>\documentclass{beamer}</code>, which is used to make
                  presentation slides.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>\usepackage[...](...)</code> allows you to load extra \(
              \LaTeX \) commands. Fundamental ones are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <code>geometry</code> package, which allows for margin
                  modification. For example,
                  <code>\usepackage[margin=1.25in]{geometry}</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <code>amsmath</code> and <code>amssymb</code> packages,
                  which are maintained by the American Mathematical Society
                  (AMS). <code>amsmath</code> has a lot of useful functionality
                  and is pretty much used by everyone. <code>amssymb</code> adds
                  several more useful math symbols.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>\usepackage{graphicx}</code> allows embedding
              <code>.jpg</code> and <code>.png</code> images.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note: All \( \LaTeX \) packages are free to use and are already
            installed by default if you get a standard distribution or use a
            website where you can create \( \LaTeX \) documents (e.g.
            <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>).
          </p>
          <h3>Document environment</h3>
          <p>
            The document environment is started with
            <code>\begin{document}</code> and ended with
            <code>\end{document}</code>. It is located after the preamble, and
            contains all of the main contents of the document.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>% This section is the preamble
  
\documentclass{article}
  
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb}
  
  
% This is where the document environment begins
  
\begin{document}
  ...
\end{document}</code>
          </pre>
        </section>
        <section id="Font_sizes" class="main-section">
          <header><h2>Font sizes</h2></header>
          <p>
            First, we can modify the font size of the entire document by adding
            optional arguments in the square brackets before the curly brackets
            of
            <code>\documentclass[]{}</code>, e.g.
            <code>\documentclass[10pt]{article}</code>. This will change the
            normal font size of the document, and adjust the other font sizes
            (small, large, etc.) relative to this.
          </p>
          <p>
            To modify font sizes, you can use these commands listed below, which
            are ordered from smallest to largest:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>\tiny</code></li>
            <li><code>\scriptsize</code></li>
            <li><code>\footnotesize</code></li>
            <li><code>\normalsize</code></li>
            <li><code>\large</code></li>
            <li><code>\Large</code></li>
            <li><code>\LARGE</code></li>
            <li><code>\huge</code></li>
            <li><code>\Huge</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>These commands can be used in either two ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Using it as a switch</b>: You can simply include the command,
              and everything that follows it will use that font size until you
              switch it to something else. This is good for long stretches of
              text with such font size. Otherwise, use the second method...
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Using curly brackets to section areas for limited scope</b>:
              You can also limit the scope of this switch by enclosing it along
              with the following text that is supposed to be affected by it
              using curly braces (<code>{}</code>). Note that this method is
              consistent with the way other "switches" generally work in \(
              \LaTeX \).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you need more font sizes, use these packages:
            <code>extsizes</code>, <code>anyfontsize</code>. However, in most
            cases, the default font sizes available should be enough.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Font_styles" class="main-section">
          <header><h2>Font styles</h2></header>
          <p>Font styles can be switched using the below functions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bold text using <code>\textbf{}</code></li>
            <li>Italic text using <code>\textit{...}</code></li>
            <li>Underline text using <code>\underline{...}</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Notice that instead of changing the font style(s) using switches
            like when changing font sizes, these act more like functions, which
            apply their actions to the text inside of the curly braces directly
            following it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a good time to note that a lot of things in \( \LaTeX \)
            involves the use of brackets. All brackets that are opened must be
            closed, or not it will throw an error when compiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a tip, since finding missing opening and/or closing brackets can
            be difficult, you may want to compile your document more often so
            that there is less areas to check where the error could happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also be careful when using underlines. Poor spacing and
            overflow can occur with long lines of underlined text as as \(
            \LaTeX \) doesn't know how to break such text into multiple lines.
            To avoid this, use the <code>ulem</code> package by including
            <code>\usepackage{ulem}</code> in the preamble, which not only fixes
            text-wrapping issues but provides additional underlines. You also
            need to use the package's notation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regular underline using <code>\uline{...}</code></li>
            <li>Double underline using <code>\uuline{...}</code></li>
            <li>Wavy underline using <code>\uwave{...}</code></li>
          </ul>
